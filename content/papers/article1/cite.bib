	abstract = {A TECHNIQUE TO ESTIMATE DENSITY AND MONITOR POPULATIONS OF THE SPOTTED NOTHURA (NOTHURA MACULOSA) IN GRASSLANDS HABITATS.— In this paper we present a technique to estimate densities and quantitatively evaluate population trends of Spotted Nothura (Nothura maculosa) in grasslands habitats. We evaluated Spotted Nothura density in the hills of Tandil, Buenos Aires Province, using two techniques: line transects with variable width and strip transects. For the latter, we also evaluated the assumption that the probability of detecting an individual within the strip was 1. Density values obtained with both techniques were similar (1.20 ind/ha for variable width transects, and 1.16 ind/ha for strip transects). We did not find significant differences among frequencies of individuals detected at different distances within the strip. We conclude that strip transects constitute a robust and efficient technique to evaluate, with a minimum cost, population trends of Spotted Nothura in grasslands and agricultural habitats. Our density estimates are among the highest reported for Buenos Aires Province, suggesting that the hills of Tandil could represent a refuge for this species.},
