	abstract = {Aim: Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a free Web-­based spatial analysis platform that requires only a web browser and an Internet connection to programmatically access and analyse data from its multi-­petabyte catalog of regularly updated satellite imagery (e.g. MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel) and other geospatial datasets. The high computing capacity of GEE can make computationally demanding analyses more accessible to researchers and practitioners, especially those with limited access to advanced computational resources. Here, we present a workflow in GEE to fit species distribution models, offering direct access to a multi-­petabyte catalog of raster products to obtain estimates of habitat suitability.},
