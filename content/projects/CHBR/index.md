title: Invasive species and biocultural conservation in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve
---

I conducted my PhD fieldwork in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Since then, I have continue working with my friends and colleagues.
My PhD work focused on studying the dynamics and impact of invasive mammalian species across the region. Invasive species are a major global problem. In the past 70 years, twelve mammal species were introduced in the Cape Horn region. I focused on three of the most invasive and harmful species introduced by the fur industry: the American beaver (**Castor canadensis**), the muskrat (**Ondatra zibethica**), and the American mink (**Neovison vison**). These species, native to North America and Canada that naturally interact in their native range, are now creating an assemblage that have a large impact on the structure and functioning of the Magellanic Sub-Antarctic ecosystems. 

In this project, we have been addressing several questions: 
- How does the invasive American mink adapt to a pristine-island ecosystem?
- Which habitats are mink using and how that changes along the year? 
- How do prey species adapt to the new predator?
- What is the impact that American mink predation has on native rodent and bird species?
- How do the three non-indigenous mammal species (American beavers, muskrats, and American mink) interact among themselves to amplify their impacts on biodiversity?
