    title: Tutorials and teaching
    text: On of my main interests is in democratizing research. I am extremely grateful for all the people that thought me in the past or wrote tutorials and books from which I learned. Conducting analyses in R, Google Earth Engine, and other open source tools is an incredible way to empower people and create new knowledge. In that spirit is that I have created a list of tutorials. This is my gift back. I hope you find them useful and inspiring for your own creations and research.
